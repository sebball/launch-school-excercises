// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.


let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);


// THis should log 2 as b which equals 2 is the variable being passed to the function, and within that black a =2.
